# goenv

Create a new go environment in the current working directory

This will create the dirs `bin`, `pkg` and `src`, update `$PATH` to include the newly created `bin` dir and update $GOPATH to be the current working directory.

# Usage

To start a new Go project

1. Download the script and put it in your $PATH (`/usr/local/bin`)
2. mkdir new_project
3. cd new_project
4. . goenv
